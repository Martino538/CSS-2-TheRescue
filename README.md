    Hi and welcome to my fancy firework project. This project is all about making a playground by using only HTML and CSS. By using only CSS, this project is a nice way to practise my CSS skills and be up-to-date with some of the newer features CSS has to offer. The name of my repo says enough about the subject of this project. It is all about... fireworks! 
</p>

<p align="center">
    Some important features in this project are:
</p>
<br />
<p align="center">- Using :has() to check if checkboxes are set</p>
<p align="center">- Using container style queries to set certain styling properties</p>
<p align="center">- Working with CSS custom properties</p>
<p align="center">- Exploring CSS keyframe animations</p>
<br />

    <strong>Please take a look a my project, I hope you like it!</strong>
